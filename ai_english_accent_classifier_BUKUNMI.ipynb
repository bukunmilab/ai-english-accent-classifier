The speaker also references American pop culture, such as Johnny Rotten and The Cramps, which are both associated with American punk rock. The speaker's use of the phrase \"rock and roll\" also suggests an American accent, as this term is more commonly used in the United States. However, without hearing the speaker's pronunciation and intonation, it's difficult to be 100% certain."
